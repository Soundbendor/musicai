    # Movement and Scrolling
    # For movement using keyboard shortcuts, fast movement is used to control the number of pixels each element
    # is moved per frame.
    #
    # For mouse movement, there are 4 values used: fast movement, fast size, slow movement, and slow size. The size
    # constants are used with screen width and height to determine where on the screen the "speed zones" are located.
    # These are calculated as such:
    #   - SCREEN_WIDTH // FAST_SIZE and SCREEN_HEIGHT // FAST_SIZE
    #   - SCREEN_WIDTH // SLOW_SIZE and SCREEN_HEIGHT // SLOW_SIZE
    #
    # FAST_SIZE = 16 means that 1/16 of the pixels on each side of the screen are used for fast movement.
    # To reduce the size of each "speed zone", change FAST_SIZE and SLOW_SIZE to a larger number.

FAST_SIZE=16
SLOW_SIZE=8

FAST_MOVEMENT=20
SLOW_MOVEMENT=10

    # at this time.
